<h1>Accessibility</h1>

    "The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their
    hardware, software, language, location, or ability. When the Web meets this
    goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement,
    sight, and cognitive ability."

    We believe that all users should have access to the best possible
    experiences. Thoughtfully designed experiences can be excellent and can be provided with minimal
    compromise. Web accessibility (a11y) is a baseline
    requirement for anything that we build; all elements are built in accordance

    <h2 data-in-page-anchor="a11y-markup">Semantic markup</h2>
    <p>
        Writing semantic HTML vastly improves the accessibility of a web page.
        Some basic best practices include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Maintain proper heading hierarchy.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This allows sighted users to easily scan and
                    understand the page structure, and it gives
                    assistive technologies landmarks to quickly navigate to.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heading levels should not be skipped, e.g., an
                    <code>h3</code> should not immediately follow an
                    <code>h1</code>.
                </li>

                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Use structured content elements.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Use <code>header</code>, <code>main</code>,
                    <code>nav</code>, <code>section</code>, and other similar
                    elements. These make it easier for those using assistive
                    technologies to navigate the page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When using a <code>section</code>, use headings within them
                    for the benefits described above.
                </li>

        <li>
            Be mindful of interactive element usage.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Restrict user interactions to interactive elements. Binding click
                    interactions to a <code>div</code> element without the proper
                    <code>aria</code> treatments can make them unreachable for some
                    users - all interactions should be reachable via keyboard.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Verify that all <code>a</code> elements have a corresponding
                    <code>href</code>. This places the link in the tab order to allow
                    for proper keyboard navigation.
                </li>
                <li>Refrain from manipulating the tab order of the page. Tab order should match the sequence of elements in the DOM and manipulating the order with <code>tabindex</code> or CSS can create a poor experience for keyboard users.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>When building a web page or application, be sure to test it with an assistive technology - preferably on multiple devices.
            <ul>
                <li>The VoiceOver Utility comes pre-installed on MacOS and iOS devices.  It works best in Safari but also works well in other browsers.</li>
                <li>Similar tools are available on Android devices and Windows PCs.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Always provide alternative text for images or interactive elements
            that do not contain text by using <code>aria-label</code>s or
            <code>alt</code> text.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Non-decorative images should always have
                    <code>alt</code> text to be read for assistive technology
                    users.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use an <code>aria-label</code> for:

                        <li>
                            items that cannot otherwise have visible text such
                            as icon buttons.

                            using <code>a11y-label</code> to prevent multiple

        <li>ARIA landmark roles and regions provide information to assistive technologies about intended behavior and give quick entry points to different regions of content. Sectioned content elements natively provide the benefits of ARIA landmark regions, i.e., the <code>nav</code> element behaves the same way that an element that has <code>role="navigation"</code> behaves.

    <h2 data-in-page-anchor="a11y-contrast">Color contrast</h2>
    <p>
        Color contrast is often used to measure element and text visibility. It has been a foundational metric for a11y compliance and WCAG 3.0 is introducing changes to the algorithm and the success criteria used to evaluate it.
    </p>
    <section>
        <h3>WCAG 2.1</h3>
        <p>
            In WCAG 2.1, color contrast is defined as the ratio between the relative luminance
            of two colors, ranging from 1:1 to 1:21; a full definition
            can be found in the
            <a

                >WCAG 2.1 documentation.</a
            >
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The minimum contrast ratio to meet the WCAG 2.0 AA standard for text
                is 4.5:1. The AAA standard is 7:1.
            </li>
            <li>
                The minimum contrast ratio to meet the WCAG 2.1 AA standard for
                interaction elements such as buttons or input borders is 3:1.
            </li>
            <li>
                There are many ways to check contrast ratio. They are often
                presented in a browser's developer tools and checkers can be found
                on many sites such as

        <h3>WCAG 3.0</h3>
        <p>
            WCAG 3.0 is adopting the Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm (APCA). Please read
            <a href="https://www.myndex.com/SAPC/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >more about the APCA</a> and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/silver/guidelines/#visual-contrast-of-text" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >how WCAG 3.0 provides ratings</a> based on it.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The algorithm yields a contrast value (L<sup>c</sup>) based on the foreground and background provided. 90L<sup>c</sup> is the value needed for a maximum WCAG 3.0 rating of 4 at 16px and font-weight of 400 - 76.5L<sup>c</sup> is the minimum needed to receive a rating of 1.</li>
            <li>APCA considers the font sizes and weights in its success criteria.</li>
            <li>Font smoothing that differs from browser defaults such as anti aliasing is  "strongly discouraged" as it "can drastically reduce contrast for small or thin fonts."</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>What does this change impact?</h3>
        <p>The change in algorithm will both cause and allow changes to existing color palettes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Viable color combinations will differ. Some combinations that passed with the 2.1 ratio will not pass with 3.0 but the opposite is also true - new combinations will become available (e.g. certain oranges and whites).</li>
            <li>The placement of colors in either the foreground or background alters the L<sup>c</sup>. As a result, combinations cannot always be inverted as they can under 2.1.</li>
            <li>Be wary of thin font-weights. Text at a font-weight of 100 does not become passable below 48px for any color combinations.</li>
        </ul>
